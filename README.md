# CS for Transfers Project 

This was a java project that replicated the reddit.com/r/place activity hosted by reddit. This activity invloved a grid of squares where
any user who was logged in could change the color of one square every x amount of time. 

We replicated place with a smaller time limit to change squares and allowed any size grid. To do this the project invloved server connections
and using the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
